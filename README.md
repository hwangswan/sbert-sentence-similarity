# Sentence Similarity with SBERT
Advanced Natural Language Processing - Master program.

VNUHCM - University of Science, Summer 2022.

## Abstraction
Based on the original paper[1] about Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks, we created a demo application calculating similarity score between two English sentences, using Cosine Similarity and all-MiniLM-L6-v2[2] pre-trained SBERT model.
